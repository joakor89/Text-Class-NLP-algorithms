Text Classification Algorithm applied on Natural Language Processing. 
This is general review on Algorithms concepts, Probability behind & Training models:

Models have been perfomed on Google Colab due Computational cost constraints
Please! feel free to applied on Notebooks environments of your preference

# Disambguity

# Viterbi Algorithm Model

```sh

So far, the duties accomplished above focus on text classification
by labelling words on grammatical categories.
Now! Let's focused on a broader approach 

# Machine Learning Classification Process:

# A) Training:
    1. Label > Extractor > Attributes > ML Algorithm

Note: Once the trained algorithm is obtained; A new document can be
set & applied the processing algorithm to retrieved attributes from it

# B) Prediction:
    1. Algorithm Application > Extractor > Attributes > Classifier Model > Label


# Classification Categories:

1. Based on Probability Theroy
2. Based on Information Theory
3. Based on Vectorial Spaces

# Word Classification

1. Name Gender Classification
2. POS Labelling 
3. By Blocking Offensive Words 

# Documents Classification

1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Conversation Topics
3. CRM's Prioritize

# Naive Bayes Classifier
